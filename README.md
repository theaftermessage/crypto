## Disclaimer
The implementation of `Shamir Secret Sharing` scheme is our own, we don't guarantee the cryptographical security and robustness. There may be some bugs, security holes and so on.

We started with this as a hobby project, it was fun to implement it ourselves. 

It should be safe, but don't trust our word, check it for yourself.
